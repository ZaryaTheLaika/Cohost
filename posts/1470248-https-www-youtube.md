**Video Description:** two 15-weeks old West Siberian Laika puppies, plowing through the deep snow in the conifers. One has floppy ear not yet erected and the other has a white blaze in the middle of its face.

Going to try and produce some laika-related shorts on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@zaryathelaika). There is not a whole lot of content about them on that website. 

(or [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@zaryathelaika) for that matter. Need to find an efficient workflow for uploading from DaVinci Resolve to my phone.)

Been meaning to journal Zarya's upbringing on there but kind of want to do it in the same format others in Russian-speaking and Finnish-speaking (and Norwegian- or Swedish-) spaces do it.
